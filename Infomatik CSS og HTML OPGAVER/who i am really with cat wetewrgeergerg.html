<h1> <strong> OM MIG </strong> </h1>
<br>
<h2> Who I am </h2>
<p> I am an 18 year old student at NSG and CBS, I take my primairy <em> High-school </em> education there and take extra classes at CBS because I like learning about <strong> ECON </strong> because it alows me to engage in the world </p>
<br>
<h3> What I do </h3>
<p> I mainy do debate on the Danish <em> WSDC-Team </em> which is engaging, I mainly do <strong> Thirds </strong> but I am currently moving towards doing more <strong> Firsts </strong> or <strong> Seconds </strong> I hope I improve on those. </p>

<p> I also play <em> DND </em> with friends because its a fun game that engages my social skills, it is fun to be an annoying prick at times, I love it. </p>

<p> I also have <em> two Cats </em> which I love to death, this is a picture of Maggie </p>

<h4> What I read </h4>
<p> Currently I am reading <em> The Plague <em> by Camus because its very good and tackles my understanding of <strong> meaning </strong> which is fun </em>
